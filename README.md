#Project Overview
In this project, we will embark on a comprehensive analysis to uncover insights into our customers, products, and market top performers. By doing so, we aim to gain a deep understanding of our business operations and areas of strength. Additionally, we will conduct an analysis of region-based market share to identify profitable regions and areas requiring further attention. This strategic approach will guide our decision-making process and resource allocation efforts.
Moreover, our focus will extend to supply chain analytics, where we will examine sold quantity and forecast quantity data. By analyzing these metrics, we can calculate key performance indicators such as Net Error and Absolute Error percentage. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the accuracy of our forecasting methods and the efficiency of our supply chain processes, allowing us to make data-driven improvements and optimize our operations.

#Skills Lernt
1.SQL Query Writing using CTE, rank, joins, date functions, sub-queries, numeric functions, etc.: Utilizing SQL, we'll craft queries employing Common Table Expressions (CTE) for iterative processing, rank functions for ordering data, joins for merging datasets, date functions for time-based analysis, sub-queries for nested operations, and numeric functions for mathematical computations.
2.Data Extraction and Transformation: We'll extract data from diverse sources, transforming it as needed to ensure consistency and compatibility. This involves cleaning, aggregating, and structuring data to facilitate analysis.
3.Data Analysis and Interpretation: Leveraging SQL queries and analytical functions, we'll analyze the transformed data to uncover insights and patterns. This includes identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies that inform decision-making.
4.Report Generation: Using the analyzed data, we'll generate reports containing actionable insights and visualizations. These reports will communicate findings effectively to stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making.
5.Problem Solving and Decision Making: Employing a combination of analytical techniques and domain knowledge, we'll address business challenges and make informed decisions based on the insights derived from data analysis. This involves identifying solutions, evaluating alternatives, and implementing strategies to drive business outcomes.
